    "- **Understanding Libraries:** Almost all major data science libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib) are built using OOP. A DataFrame in Pandas is an object. A LinearRegression model in Scikit-learn is an object. Understanding OOP will demystify how these libraries work and allow you to use them more effectively."
